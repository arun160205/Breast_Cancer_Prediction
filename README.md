# Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to use deep learning to detect breast cancer from medical images like mammograms, ultrasounds, MRIs, and histopathology images. Breast cancer involves the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the breast. Techniques like mammography (X-rays), ultrasound (sound waves), MRI (magnetic fields), and histopathology (microscopic tissue examination) are used to detect it. Deep learning, which involves advanced computer algorithms, will help analyze these images. The project's goals are to create an accurate model, improve it with data augmentation and transfer learning, and assist medical professionals in early detection. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, train the model, and evaluate it. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under the MIT License.
